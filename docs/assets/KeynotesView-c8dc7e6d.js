After recalling the risk management principles adopted by traditional systems engineering, we explore the extent to which they can be applied to AI systems.We explain that traditional techniques, which at the development time allow guaranteeing desirable properties, cannot be transposed to AI systems, as they are not explainable and do not lend themselves to model-based analysis. An alternative approach applied to complex heterogeneous systems, is to define a reference architecture that enables compositional reasoning for existing solutions, considering the correctness of each of their components separately. We propose a reference architecture for AI agents and perform a high-level analysis of the current state of agent AI with regard to the main trends as well as the completeness and safety of existing solutions. Another direction is to guarantee the desirable properties of AI systems a posteriori, using test methods, as verification is not applicable due to the absence of faithful behavioral models. Clearly, rigorous testing can only be applied to systems whose input-output relationship does not involve sensory or linguistic data. For the latter, we must limit ourselves to validating subjective human-centric properties, assessing the extent to which AI systems can be aligned with human values. We propose a method for specifying and testing these properties under certain conditions, highlighting the distinctive human features that machines can hardly reproduce. In conclusion, we emphasize the need to remain within the framework of risk-based approaches for AI systems, which implies that their use in critical applications would require considerable effort to develop new bases for guaranteeing their trustworthiness.</p><div class="bold" data-v-7093cbba>Bio:</div><p class="italic" data-v-7093cbba>Joseph Sifakis is emeritus CNRS Research Director at Verimag, Saint-Martin-d’Hères, France, a laboratory that he founded and directed for 13 years.

However, as the scale of software becomes larger and the architecture becomes more and more complex, especially the network-linked software is more and more common, which makes the traditional software reliability engineering highlight many limitations in practical applications. The rise of artificial intelligence technology has brought new impetus to software reliability engineering. The report will focus on the problems faced by software reliability engineering technology in practical applications, and introduce how to use artificial intelligence technology in some important units of software reliability engineering, so as to further strengthen software reliability engineering technology and provide reliability guarantee for more complex software systems.</p><div class="bold" data-v-7093cbba>Bio:</div><p class="italic" data-v-7093cbba>Jun Ai, Professor, Vice Dean of School of Reliability and Systems Engineering, Beihang University, China, Deputy Director of Reliability Engineering Technology Research Center, Chair of IEEE Reliability Society Beijing Chapter, Senior Member of IEEE and CCF.

Distinguished from conventional networks by their larger scale, extended operational lifecycles, and intricate service profiles, computing networks present unique challenges in terms of reliability assessment and enhancement. A pressing issue that requires immediate attention is the development of methodologies for the swift and precise evaluation of computing network reliability, along with targeted strategies for improvement. In response to this, this research introduces a reliability analysis and validation methodology for computing networks based on the System Engineering V-model. Oriented to three hierarchical levels—connectivity, performance, and service, it is intended to analyze both singular and coupled failure modes. Additionally, it proposes the methodologies for generating service profiles and flow of computing networks. subsequently, this research conducts reliability simulation assessments, thereby providing an evaluative foundation and guiding principles for optimizing the reliability design of computing networks.</p><div class="bold" data-v-7093cbba>Bio:</div><p class="italic" data-v-7093cbba>Xing Pan is director of the Security Center for Systems and Intelligent Systems, head of the Department of Safety Science and Engineering, quality management expert of AVIC Group, and editorial board of Systems Engineering and Electronic Technology.
